# Matched

Matched is an open-source project that scores energy suppliers on the carbon content of their electricity.
</p></header>


The mission of Matched is to **accelerate the widespread adoption of deeply-decarbonised electricity**.

Matched is the first project of its kind to use **public datasets** and a principled model of the grid to calculate the carbon content of suppliers' electricity on an **hourly basis**.
Our scoreboard gives homeowners and business owners a **new level of insight** when choosing a low-carbon supplier.

We work with suppliers and other experts in the field to ensure that our methods and scores are accurate, and our methodology, analyses, and code are **open-source and peer-reviewed**.

We are an **independent and not-for-profit** project funded entirely by philanthropic grants.
