        Clean electrification is essential to net-zero goals and yet there remains confusion about what constitutes 'clean'.
        Matched is a not-for-profit initiative that develops transparent metrics, scores energy suppliers, and promotes the development of low-carbon energy plans.

Our mission is accelerate the offer of **electricity** plans which are **low-carbon** and **fully transparent** about the origination of power.

We focus on the **supply-business** which procures electricity on behalf of commercial, industrial, and domestic customers. With public datasets we track the **carbon intensity** of power from each major supplier. We work with leading suppliers to promote the **cleanest tariffs**.

  Our code and results are all **open-source** and we actively engage industry experts, including from energy suppliers, to validate and refine our methodology. We are a **not-for-profit** organisation funded entirely by philanthropic donations.
