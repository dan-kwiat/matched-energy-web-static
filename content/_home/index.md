# Matched

<header><p class="post-desc fw-light mb-4">
Clean electricity is critical to the decarbonisation of homes and businesses but there has been no detailed and dependable way to rate the offers on the market.
Matched is an open-source initiative that evaluates energy suppliers and the degree to which they have decarbonised the electricity they sell to their customers.
</p></header>


The mission of the Matched initiative is to accelerate the widespread adoption of deeply-decarbonised electricity.

We use public datasets to analyse the power bought and sold by leading suppliers on an hour-by-hour basis and to score suppliers based on the degree to which they have decarbonised the power they sell to their customers.

We work with suppliers and other experts in the field to ensure that our methods and scores are accurate, and all our methodologies and code are open-sourced and peer-reviewed.

We are a not-for-profit initiative funded entirely by philanthropic donations.
