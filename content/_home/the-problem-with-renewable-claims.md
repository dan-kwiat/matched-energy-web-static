Claims and implications

Observations:
- the grid must be balanced at all times
    schematic
- we don't have much energy storage or demand-flexibility
    numbers
- tariffs are cheap
    numbers

Principled analysis:
- would require a lot of storage/flexibility
- which would come at high cost
-> unlikely that is truly '100% renewable'

Data analysis:
- [a better yardstick](/a-better-yardstick)
- octopus
- good energy
- squeaky clean
- link to scoreboard

Annual matching:
- schematic

Problems:
1. implies can shift energy
    no other part of the supply sector gets away with this
2. not 100% matched - mis-selling
3. complacency & not differentiating industry leaders

Doing better:
- a better yardstick
- why this is important
