Over the last decade it has become increasingly common for suppliers to compete for environmentally-conscious customers by marketing their electricity as "100% renewable" and about a third of British homes are now on these 'green tariffs'.

But what does "100% Renewable" mean?

What it strongly _implies_ is that all electricity consumed is, at all times, directly supplied from a wind farm, solar farm, or some other renewable source like hydroelectric or renewable biomass. This is a simple and compelling image and one that the vast majority of people, who spend very little time thinking about it, will accept at face-value.

But can it be true that a third of British homes are really getting renewable electricity all the time?

Wasn't grid-decarbonisation meant to be a huge challenge? Isn't renewable generation inherently intermittent? What about on a cold, still night when there's no solar or wind energy but we're at home with the lights and TVs on?

Does the claim stack up?

## There's only one grid
The first charge that could be leveled against the claim is that there is only one electrical grid, one set of wires.

Electricity generators contribute their power into the grid and consumers indiscriminately withdraw from it. At the physical level there is no need - nor any means - to determine where power came from or where it's going.

No one customer is any more connected to a wind- or solar-farm than any other customer.

## Contractual provenance
![Supplier balancing](/home/assets/grid-balancing-supplier.png){: w="450" h="300" .right}

However, physics notwithstanding, at a _contractual level_ customers can meaningfully own the power from wind- or solar-farms by virtue of the supplier they choose.

The role of the supplier is to balance supply and demand: for every unit of power they sell to consumers they must be contracted to buy a unit of power from a generator. hey must also pay for the distribution of their power over the grid.

The contractual balance of supply and demand underpins the energy sector and is critical to the health of the electrical grid. When suppliers underestimate demand they need to buy power on the spot market and, similarly, when demand is overestimated suppliers need to sell. Suppliers that don't adequately manage the risk of an imbalance between supply and demand risk of insolvency[^insolvency].

[^insolvency]: It was because of unhedged imbalance that why many suppliers went bankrupt in the UK after the onset of the Ukrainian war in 2022.

So, although it is indeed that case that power doesn't physically flow from a specific generator to a specific consumer, there is a very real contractual connection and this connection underpins the entire sector.

If your supplier is genuinely procuring renewables on your behalf then your power is contractually and genuinely clean.

## Handling intermittency
The bigger challenges to suppliers' claim are that (a) the grid must be balanced at all times and that (b) renewables are intermittent.

**Grid balancing**
![Grid Balancing](/home/assets/grid-balancing.png){: w="450" h="300" .right}\
The grid must be in perfect equipoise at all moments, hour by hour, second by second. Whatever is consumed from the grid must be met in equal and simultaneous measure by the generators that feed the grid.

A reasonable analogy[^voltage-water] is a reservoir of water that must always be at a particular height: whatever water is withdrawn must be immediately replaced.

[^voltage-water]: Where the height of the water in the reservoir represents the voltage of the grid

The grid is intricately balanced by a combination of power markets, automatic micro-adjustments by generators, and direct intervention by National Grid. Even slight imbalances can lead to equipment failure, brown-outs, and blackouts.

**The intermittency of renewables**
![Intermittency of renewables](/home/assets/missing.png){: w="450" h="300" .right}\
And yet the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow!

So, in order for the grid to remain balanced, when there's a scarcity of wind and solar power it must be met by 'firm supply' which, currently, is predominantly gas-powered power plants.

<br>
## Flexibility
Long-term we need to be able to work around the intermittency of renewable generation by:

1. **Flexing supply (generation)** by charging batteries when renewables are abundant and discharging them when they are scarce

2. **Flexing demand (consumption)** by discounting power when renewables are abundant to incentivise consumers to shift their consumption (schemes like the [agile tariff from Octopus](https://octopus.energy/smart/agile/) already do this)

![Matching supply and demand](/home/assets/solar-matching-flexibility-annotation.png){: w="800" h="400"}

Flexibility is essential for the deep decarbonisation of the grid, but we currently don't have very much of it.

The number of batteries on the grid has grown from essentially nothing to XX over the last five years and numbers are expected to triple again in the next couple of years, but the total capacity is still tiny when compared to the rest of the grid.

![Flexibility versus consumption](/home/assets/missing.png){: w="450" h="300" .right}
We don't yet have enough batteries to shift even 1% of our daily usage, let alone to move wind energy from a windy week to a still week or solar energy from the summer to the winter.

Our ability to flex demand will increase as our homes are electrified, and much of it will be done in the background, without us noticing, by smart-devices that respond to grid signals.

However, power remains a cheap commodity, life is busy, convenience is king, and so most consumption will remain fairly inflexible. The value of demand flexibility will mostly be during the few hours of the year when the grid is most stretched - for example very cold evenings when the wind isn't blowing.

In order for our grid to function with a high penetration of renewables we need a lot more flexibility[^fuel-mix].

[^fuel-mix]: there are other 'firm' renewables: pumped hydro and renewable biofuel

<!-- Indeed, this is one of the reasons why it is so important that consumers understand what they are getting from the "100% renewable" offers. If power isn't already genuinely decarbonised it needs to be - pronto - with a lot more renewables and flexibility. And suppliers play a crucial role in rendering the preferences and payments of environmentally conscious customers into new grid infrastructure (more on this in future posts). <!-- TODO: add link -->

## Not as it first appears
We've established that it is reasonable for suppliers to market renewable power based on the power they have procured for their customers: though all power is mixed on the grid there is a real contractual provenance (which underpins the balancing of the entire power sector).

However, we've also established that it would be very difficult, impossible even, for a supplier to perfectly match their renewable supply with their consumers' demand. Renewables are intermittent and both generation and consumption are currently very inflexible!

With current grid infrastructure it would be inordinately expensive for suppliers guarantee that all consumption is at all times met by renewable supply[^green-premium], and it is totally implausible that a third of British homes consume electricity that is exclusively renewable.

[^green-premium]: Whereas the premium for a green tariff is generally only 5%

So, "100% renewable" cannot mean that that all consumption is at all times supplied by renewable generation.

## A definitive view
We can use public data sources to get a definitive view of what suppliers are selling.

This methodology has been developed by Matched with contributions from experts in the field: our code [is open-source](https://github.com/matched-energy/scores) and our approach will be described in detail in a future post.

We'll dig into the situation at Octopus since they are one of the largest suppliers that markets their electricity as exclusively renewable. The results for other suppliers are shown on the [scoreboard](/scoreboard).

<!-- TODO: add labels to charts and make prettier -->
![Octopus imbalance in May](/home/assets/octopus-imbalance-may-2022.png){: w="800" h="500"}
_The supply / demand balance at Octopus in May 2022: the filled curves show renewable supply and demand is shown by the black line_

This chart mostly makes sense: demand is lowest in the early morning and highest in the evening. The supply is mostly from wind which is sporadic, but there's also a fair amount of solar which has a daily period.

What is immediately clear is that supply and demand are _not_ synchronised: in the beginning of the month demand exceeds supply whereas later in the month the converse is true.

![Octopus imbalance in October and November](/home/assets/octopus-imbalance-oct-nov-2022.png){: w="550" h="320" .right}
The situation later in the year is similar: in October there is a surplus of wind and supply exceeds demand whereas in November there is much less wind and demand exceeds supply.

The pattern repeats throughout the year: sometimes exceeds demand and demand sometimes exceeds supply. There is no balance between supply and demand.

## Annual matching
On an hourly basis there is an obvious imbalance between the demand of Octopus customers and the supply of renewables that have been procured on their behalf. But, as it turns out, the supply and demand when aggregated over all hours and days of the year are the same!

And _this_ is what '100% Renewable' means!

It means that _over the course of a year_ a supplier is procuring enough renewable supply to satisfy their demand. Customers aren't being served renewable power at all times but - _on average_ - their consumption is met by an equivalent volume of renewable supply.

Consumption on a calm night when there's no wind or solar is actually fossil-fueled but sometime later there'll be an abundance of wind and solar and, when aggregated annually, the total demand is equivalent to the total supply.

The accounting is very approximate and at odds with the rest of the supply business and the physics of the grid which require instantaneous balance between supply and demand.

<!-- TODO
This is unphysical since the grid must always be perfectly balanced, and it's unlike the other responsibilities of a supplier which are to ensure the supply/demand balance at all times.

And it's confusing at best and misleading at worse but this is the standard that has been adopted by the sector and which has been allowed by the regulator.
-->

## Can we do better?
Annual matching is simple and it was implemented a long time ago. It allowed a simple, hopeful message to be conveyed a large number of consumers who generally don't have much time for their energy supplier, and it was probably better than nothing.

But, clearly, annual matching is an accounting trick which entirely disregards the physical challenge of running a highly renewable grid.

It implies that solar power can trivially be consumed at night and that wind power can be magically shifted across seasons.

Increasingly the decarbonisation of the grid depends, not just on more renewable power, but more renewable power at the right time. At some times of the year we already have _too much_ renewable power and the output of wind- and solar-farms needs to be curtailed [^curtailment]. And increasingly we need to focus on the conditions that are hard to decarbonise: when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. Annual matching is flawed because it disregards these challenges.

The better measure is how well a supplier matches supply with demand, hour by hour and day by day, in keeping with the way that the supply-sector usually works.

[^curtailment]: TODO, mention price cannibalisation

## The stakes
Suppliers are uniquely positioned to drive net-zero investments in that they render the needs and desires of end-consumers into power-procurement contracts.

Consumers are increasingly conscious of the environmental footprint of their electricity supply - over a third of British homes are on green tariffs - and willing to pay for cleaner products. Some green tariffs fetch as much as a XX% premium and, as a whole, in the UK alone, green tariffs raise an extra £500M a year.

Suppliers that serve environmentally conscious customers play an important role in signaling to the market the desire for low-carbon power. And for the signal to be well-directed, suppliers need to be measured against the right measures.

## Instantaneous balancing
![Grid Balancing](/home/assets/grid-balancing.png){: w="550" h="366" .right}
The bigger challenge to suppliers' renewables claim is that of intermittency - the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow!

And yet the grid must be perfectly balanced at all moments, instantaneously, second-by-second. Whatever consumers demand from the grid must be met in equal and instantaneous measure by generators that feed the grid.

The balancing act is incredible and intricate dance of the power markets, automatic micro-adjustments from generators, and direct interventions by the control room at National Grid. Even slight imbalances can lead to equipment failure, brown-outs, and blackouts.

So, in order for consumption to be powered by a wind-farm it must be simultaneous to the generation and, similarly, in order to be solar-powered consumption needs to be during the day!

## Flexibility
There are two mechanisms by which to handle the intermittency of wind- and solar-power:

Supply-side flexibility:
: Charge/discharge batteries when wind/solar are abundant/scarce

Demand-side flexibility:
: Plans like the [agile tariff from Octopus](https://octopus.energy/smart/agile/) offer discounts - or even free electricity - when renewables are abundant


The number of batteries on the grid has exploded: up nearly 10x over the last five years, with another 3x forecast in the next two years. However, we still don't even have the capacity to shift 1% of daily generation, let alone move energy between weeks or months.

Demand-flexibility is an increasingly valuable lever as we electrify our homes and, to some degree, smart-devices can automatically shift their load based on signals from the grid. However, power remains a cheap commodity and convenience is king, so most consumption will be fairly inelastic and demand-flexibility will have a marginal effect on the grid[^flexibility].

[^flexibility]: Demand-flexibility is most valuable during times of duress, when the grid is most stretched.

We need a lot more flex on the grid to handle a high penetration of renewables (more on this in future posts).

[^fuel-mix]: there are other 'firm' renewables: pumped hydro and renewable biofuel

## '100% Renewable'

So, we've established that:

**1) A supplier can market 'renewable energy' if they procure enough to meet their consumers' demand**
Physically this power is indistinguishable from the power procured by other suppliers, but in terms of the contractual framing that underpins the grid the suppliers' power is clearly designated for their customers.

**2) Generation and consumption must be synchronised**
Since the grid must be instantaneously balanced, and because there is currently very little supply- or demand-side flexibility.

The second condition is problematic! Given the intermittency of wind and solar and the very limited flexibility of the current grid it would be impossible (or at least inordinately expensive [^expensive]) for a supplier to synchronise generation and consumption.

[^expensive]: Whereas green tariffs generally only fetch a 5% margin over 'dirty' tariffs

So the claim of "100% renewables" _cannot_ mean that all power consumed at all times is renewable!
