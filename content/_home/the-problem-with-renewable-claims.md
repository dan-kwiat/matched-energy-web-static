Over the last decade it has become increasingly common for suppliers to compete for environmentally-conscious customers by marketing their electricity as "100% renewable" and about a third of British homes are now on these 'green tariffs'.

But what does "100% Renewable" mean?

What it strongly _implies_ is that all electricity consumed is, at all times, directly supplied from a wind farm, solar farm, or some other renewable source like hydroelectric or renewable biomass. This is a simple and compelling image and one that the vast majority of people, who spend very little time thinking about it, will accept at face-value.

But can it be true that a third of British homes are really getting renewable electricity all the time?

Wasn't grid-decarbonisation meant to be a huge challenge? Isn't renewable generation inherently intermittent? What about on a cold, still night when there's no solar or wind energy but we're at home with the lights and TVs on?

Does the claim stack up?


## One set of wires
The first charge that could be leveled against the claim is that there is only one electrical grid.

It's just one set of wires, one high-voltage pool that connects us: electricity generators contribute their power into the grid and electricity consumers withdraw from it. Generation and consumption are both indiscriminate, without any need (or ability) to discern the source or destination of power.

At a physical level, no one customer is any more connected to a wind- or solar-farm than any other customers.


## Contractual provenance
![Supplier balancing](/home/assets/grid-balancing-supplier.png){: w="400" h="266" .right}
However, physics notwithstanding, there is a meaningful sense in which customers can be associated with wind- or solar-farms, by virtue of the supplier they choose.

The role of the supplier is to balance supply and demand, and for every unit of power they sell they must contract a unit of power to buy. They must also pay for the distribution of that power via the grid.

The contractual balance between supply demand, as managed by suppliers, is critical the balance of the grid. A supplier is exposed to the market whenever the have an imbalance in supply and demand, and the recent bankruptcies were of suppliers who hadn't adequately managed this risk.

So, although on the grid there's no _physical_ connection between generation and consumption, there is a very real _contractual_ connection which underpins the entire sector.

And, if your supplier is genuinely procuring revenues on your behalf your power is genuinely, albeit contractually, clean.

## Instantaneous balancing
![Grid Balancing](/home/assets/grid-balancing.png){: w="400" h="266" .right}
The bigger challenge to suppliers' renewables claim is that of intermittency - the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow!

And yet the grid must be perfectly balanced at all moments, instantaneously, second-by-second. Whatever consumers demand from the grid must be met in equal and instantaneous measure by generators that feed the grid.

The balancing act is incredible and intricate dance of the power markets, automatic micro-adjustments from generators, and direct interventions by the control room at National Grid. Even slight imbalances can lead to equipment failure, brown-outs, and blackouts.

So, in order to consume power from a wind-farm I need to do so at exactly the same time that power is generated and, similarly, in order to be solar-powered I need to consume electricity during the day!

## Handling intermittency
There are two mechanisms by which to handle the intermittency of wind- and solar-power:

Flex supply (generation) with batteries
: Charge/discharge batteries when wind/solar are abundant/scarce

Flex demand (consumption) with incentives
: Plans like the [agile tariff from Octopus](https://octopus.energy/smart/agile/) offer discounts - or even free electricity - when renewables are abundant

## Limited flex
The number of batteries on the grid has exploded: up nearly 10x over the last five years, with another 3x forecast in the next two years. However, we still don't even have the capacity to shift 1% of daily generation, let alone move energy between weeks or months.

Demand-flexibility is an increasingly valuable lever as we electrify our homes and, to some degree, smart-devices can automatically shift their load based on signals from the grid. However, power remains a cheap commodity and convenience is king, so most consumption will be fairly inelastic and demand-flexibility will have a marginal effect on the grid[^flexibility].

[^flexibility]: Demand-flexibility is most valuable during times of duress, when the grid is most stretched.

We need a lot more flex on the grid to handle a high penetration of renewables (more on this in future posts).

## A principled analysis
Putting all this together:





Observations:
- the grid must be balanced at alll16ggl times
    schematic
- we don't have much energy storage or demand-flexibility
    numbers
- tariffs are cheap
    numbers

Principled analysis:
- would require a lot of storage/flexibility
- which would come at high cost
-> unlikely that is truly '100% renewable'

Data analysis:
- [a better yardstick](/a-better-yardstick)
- octopus
- good energy
- squeaky clean
- link to scoreboard

Annual matching:
- schematic

Problems:
1. implies can shift energy
    no other part of the supply sector gets away with this
2. not 100% matched - mis-selling
3. complacency & not differentiating industry leaders

Doing better:
- a better yardstick
- why this is important
