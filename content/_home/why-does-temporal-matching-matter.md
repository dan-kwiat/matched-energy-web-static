Though it might first appear to be a technical detail, temporal matching is very important for four reasons:

## Grid physics
For the electrical grid to function supply and demand have to be continuously balanced, moment by moment, day by day.

Certificate-based accounting cannot represent power-flow and the challenges of running a low-carbon, highly renewable grid until it is temporally matched.

Energy suppliers are already responsible for temporally matching their positions in power markets so are constitutionally capable of temporally-matched certificates.
 initiative from some      energy suppliers themselves who are starting to offer temporally-matched power to commercial customers[^good-energy].

## Transparent marketing
The power sector is complex and most consumers have very little time or interest for it and, as a result, would be entirely excused for assuming that tariffs branded "100% renewable" do - in actual fact - deliver power to their homes that is exclusively renewable at all times.

Given this confusion there is a risk of broken trust and a backlash against all clean-power offers and already, there have been some high-profile repudiations of certificate-based claims[^repudiations].

[^repudiations]: TODO

The issue is not with certificates: they remain a good method for allowing renewable power to be distinguished from fossil-fueled power and sold on open, liquid markets. The issue is that certificates need to be temporally matched with demand.

## Market signals
Green tariffs have the potential to incentivise the development of renewable grid infrastructure: consumers pay a premium for cleaner power which, via certificates, accumulates to the investors behind renewable projects.

A third of British homes are now paying roughly a 5% premium for a green tariff[^green-tariff-numbers] with a combined effect of of £500M/year which, ostensibly, funds renewable energy.

But the growing consensus is that, as renewables become increasingly cost-competitive on unsubsidised terms, the current system does little to inform or incentivise new grid developments because the market signal is too weak and diffuse.

Part of the issue is that matching is too easy, and too cheap, without temporal matching. Increasingly grids face an _oversupply_ of renewables at certain times of the year[^curtailment] and the challenge is not just to produce renewable power, but to produce it at the _right time_.

[^curtailment]: TODO

Temporally-matched green tariffs would send a clearer market signal by:
1. Raising the bar, allowing more differentiation between tariffs, and enabling the cleanest offers to charge a higher premium
2. Incentivising the energy storage and load flexibility that are essential for the high penetration of renewable generation

The same studies that demonstrate the inefficacy of green tariffs _without_ temporal matching also unanimously conclude that voluntary clean-power markets _with_ temporal matching would meaningfully and substantially influence grid investments[^energy-tag-additionality].

## Urgency
Electricity already accounts for a third of global emissions and its consumption almost doubles under most net-zero scenarios. The imperative to decarbonise electricity is clear but the urgency is lost in vague and potentially misleading claims.

If it really were the case that electricity could be fully decarbonised for just an extra 5% cost climate change would be much less of an issue.

The metrics by which we judge clean power need to be clear, frank, and physical.

## The temporal movement
Matched is part of a growing movement that is calling for the widespread adoption of temporal-matching.

Other champions of the movement include tech giants[^google-microsoft], independent non-profit groups[^energy-tag], and startups[^granular-energy] who provide temporal-matching software to the industry. Excitingly there is also initiative from some energy suppliers themselves who are starting to offer temporally-matched power to commercial customers[^good-energy].

Our grids are changing fast and our practices need to change with them... <and it will be exciting to see where we end up>.

====================

## Temporal-matching
Without certificates that are temporally matched, power can not be regarded as exclusively renewable.

And yet the current practice amongst suppliers who offer green tariffs is to buy certificates that match their power on a volumetric and locational basis but **not** on a temporal basis, and it is only within these very lenient terms that they are '100% renewable'.

And without temporality, the matching process is pretty easy since renewable certificates can be bought at any time[^annual-matching] to offset consumption at any other time and, as a result, there is little market competition and the price of certificates is low[^certificate-prices].

And low certificate prices means that green tariffs do little to incentivise the development of new renewable projects.


[^certificate-prices]: In the most recent compliance-cycle prices were [as low as £2.50/MWh](https://montelnews.com/news/7de0555e-2427-4726-9fc9-c7bd7560d10b/uk-rego-prices-slump-80-ahead-of-compliance-deadline)
## Raising the bar
Matched is part of a growing movement that calls for a disambiguation of terms since power that isn't backed by temporally-matched certificates cannot be regarded as exclusively renewable.

<!-- TODO: have a page on the temporal-matching movement -->

The Matched [scoreboard](/scoreboard) rates suppliers ability to temporally match supply and demand and, even amongst those with green tariffs, identifies notable differences between suppliers.
